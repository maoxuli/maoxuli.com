        <p class="highlight">Welcome to my homepage. Businesses and individuals can find my resume, learn about my programming
            and professional experience, and get my contact information to hire me. Friends can read my blogs and enjoy the 
            rest of my site.</p>
        <p class="highlight">I currently live in Washington DC and is a graduate student of The George Washington University. 
            I am also working on a open source project PPEngine, which is meanwhile my class project. When I am not working 
            I spend most of the time on learning English to adapt myself to the new life in the US.</p>
        <h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
        <p class="highlight">Maoxu Li is a senior software developer with more than 10 years' work experience. He used to be 
            a programmer, a software architect, a team leader, and a project director in China. His areas of interests include
            peer-to-peer (P2P), distributed systems, self organising networks, but more specifically Autonomic Content 
            Distribution Networks. He enjoys coding and is fluent in C/C++.</p>
        <p>His undergraduate study majored in Communications Engineering and his first job in 1997 was on a Telecommunications 
            Management Networks (TMN) system. These backgrounds gave him a much deep  understanding of the principles of 
            modern communications and computer networks, especially of the the layered reference models and the relevant 
            protocols.  One years later, he started working as a software developer. It was still the clear thinking of 
            layered architecture in system analysis and design that benefited him greatly.</p>
        <p>From 2001 to  2005, he worked on a projects to develop video surveillance systems and there he specialized in 
            transmitting video over Internet and accumulated abundant experience in network programming. In 2006, he went to 
            the field of peer-to-peer (P2P) networking. He led teams developing a peer-to-peer video streaming system 
            and the operating support system (OSS). </p>
        <p>Currently, he is working on an open source project, <a href="http://www.ppengine.net/">PPEngine</a>, to explore 
            the possibility of Internet that works in a peer-to-peer (P2P) fashion.</p>
        <p>In working, Maoxu Li is a team player  with superb interpersonal and communicational skills particularly in 
            conveying  complex technical information in a clear and convincing manner to diverse  audiences. In actual life, 
            he is a versatile person with widespread  interests in all kinds of DIY, such as computer hardware, household 
            electronic appliance,  and even cooking and gardening.</p>
