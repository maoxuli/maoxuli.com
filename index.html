        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>His undergraduate study majored in Communications Engineering and his first job in 1997 was on a Telecommunications 
            Management Networks (TMN) system. These backgrounds gave him a much deep  understanding of the principles of modern 
            communications and computer networks, especially of the the layered reference models and the relevant protocols.  
            One year later, he started to work as a software developer. It was still the clear thinking of layered architecture 
            in system analysis and design that benefited him greatly.</p>
        <p>From 2001 to  2005, he worked on a project to develop video surveillance systems. There he specialized in transmitting 
            video over network and accumulated abundant experience in network programming. In 2006, he went to the field of 
            peer-to-peer (P2P) networking. He led teams to develop a peer-to-peer (P2P) video streaming system and the operating 
            support system (OSS). </p>
        <p>Currently, he is working on an open source project, <a href="http://www.ppengine.com/">PPEngine</a>, to explore the 
            possibility of Internet that works in a peer-to-peer (P2P) fashion. This is also his class project.</p>
        <p>In the work, Maoxu Li is a team player  with superb interpersonal and communicational skills particularly in conveying  
            complex technical information in a clear and convincing manner to diverse  audiences. In actual life, he is a versatile 
            person with widespread  interests in all kinds of DIY, such as computer hardware, household electronic appliance,  
            and even cooking and gardening.</p>
