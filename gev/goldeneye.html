                    <p>Golden Eye Technology developed the first PC-based DVR (Digital Video Recorder) 
                       in China in 1997 and successfully used in digital video surveillance system. 
                       I joined Golden Eye Technology in November 2002 as a Software Engineer 
                       (C++ Programmer) in a software development team. My task is software maintenance, 
                       as well as some improving development.</p>

            <h3>About the product</h3>
            <p>From the middle of 1990s, digital video surveillance system was used in safeguarding
               applications to upgrade previous CCTV (Closed-circuit Television) system.
               GoldenEye digital video surveillance system was one of the first products that 
               dominated Chinese market. GoldenEye is a PC-based system that makes it very easy 
               to evolve with the needs of market and the progress of technology.</p>
            <p>Early versions of GoldenEye system worked in a local mode. The system core is 
               DVR (Digital Video Recorder). Multiple videos are connected into local 
               surveillance center via cables, captured and compressed with DVR, then recorded 
               into disk files. Usually, the surveillance center  
               equipped with a video monitors array (or display wall). The system provides 
               interface to control the displaying and recording of the videos. In addition, the system 
               may integrate functions like alarms I/O, video motion or audio silence detection, timing 
               actions, or actions driven by events.</p>
            <p>The broad-band networks were widely deployed from the last of 1990s, which together 
               with the advancing of digital video compression techniques, made it possible to 
               transmit multiple videos over networks. Functions like remote video surveillance 
               were introduced into digital video surveillance system. The video compressed with 
               MPEG-1 or H.261/263 standards can be transmitted from local surveillance center to 
               remote users in the form of stream media. The users may watch one to four videos 
               remotely over Intranet, even Internet. </p>
            <p>The rapid growth of Internet band-width and high-efficient video compress standards 
               like MPEG-4 and H.264 make it possible to transmit high-quality videos over Internet. 
               To support larger scale video surveillance, the surveillance center of the new system 
               is not set on local any more. Videos in a large geographical range are 
               captured and compressed locally, then transmitted to the surveillance center over 
               network (or Internet). The videos are recorded into disk files or decompressed and 
               displayed on monitors. This kind of video surveillance system is named 
               NVR (Network Video Recorder).
