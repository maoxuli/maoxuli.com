                    <p>Originated in my hands-on projects for my coursework at The George Washington University,  
                       I did refactoring of a peer-to-peer (P2P) video streaming system 
                       on code, design, and architecture level. 
                       Functions involving peer-to-peer communications between devices behind NAT (Network 
                       Address Translation) were moved into a separate software framework (PPIO). 
                       Video streaming and peer-to-peer overlay networking were also re-designed to realize 
                       a kind of independency.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="clear"></div>
            </div>
            <h3>Systems Architecture</h3>
            <p>PPIO is a software framework to ease the programming of network communications involving 
               devices behind NAT. A service system (a single server or a distributed network) consists of devices 
               in public domain (with public IP addresses) is used as a helper to make devices behind NAT reachable. 
               The procedure to establish peer-to-peer connections is wrapped in PPIO.</p>
            <p>PPStream is designed as a local helper service that downloads video contents with multiple ways to 
               ensure playback quality. The video data (RTP packets) is stored in a buffer first and then fed to 
               the player with RTSP protocol or alternatives. Different from traditional stream media system, in 
               which all clients connect to the dedicated server and download media contents, 
               PPStream works in a peer-to-peer fashion. At most cases, PPStream nodes connect to each other directly, 
               exchange their buffering information, and propagate video contents as needed. Accessing server occurs 
               only if the data is urgent as to a time window of playback. A PPStream node keeps track on a small 
               sub-set of all nodes in the system, organizes them into three layers of Members, Neighbors, and 
               Partners according to the possibility of sharing data with them. Buffering information of a node is 
               packeted into a message and propagated among nodes with a Gossip-like protocol that is optimized for 
               media streaming applications. Please find source code and documents at 
               <a href="https://github.com/ppengine/">Github</a>.</p>

            <h3>About the system</h3>
            <p>FireWind P2P video streaming system is an integrable solution for video broadcast (TV) and 
               video-on-demand (VOD) over Internet. Compressed video data is extracted from video files or 
               real-time video streams by dedicated media servers, wrapped into slice packets, 
               then fed into a peer-to-peer overlay network consists of users. The sliced video data 
               are propagated among users on the need basis. The structure of the peer-to-peer overlay network 
               and the strategy of sharing data are designed for the special needs of video 
               streaming to ensure quick start and smooth playback. They are different from those in typical 
               file sharing applications like Bittorrent.</p>
            <p>FireWind IPTV system consists of P2P video streaming system and the operations support system (OSS). 
               Its back end includes a contents publishing system and a video advertisements management system.

            <h3>About the system</h3>
            <p>Safeguarding system was expected to be a part of enterprise information architecture.  
               Current digital video surveillance systems were not easy to integrate with management 
               information system (MIS). 
               GEV/DVx tried to construct a new software framework for digital video applications, in which 
               the devices, data, work flows, work log, even states are treated as resources under the 
               information architecture. To be simple, GEV/DVx was designed to support the networking, 
               intelligence, 
               and informatization of safeguarding system based on digital video surveillance.</p>
            <p>Functionally, GEV/DVx consists of two parts.
               Application management information system (MIS) and real-time digital video processing system.
               The management of hardware and software, users, data, log, and states are based on typical 
               MIS architecture, which make it easy to integrate with other applications. 
               Digital video processing system is a DirectShow-like framework, which concentrates on 
               media-related work, including video capture 
               and display, record and transfer, state control and actions, audio and video 
               detection and analysis. Functions are wrapped into filters that can be configured to connect
               to each other to complete requirement functions.</p>

                       I joined Golden Eye Technology in November 2002 as a Software Engineer 
                       (C++ Programmer) in a software development team. My task is software maintenance,

            <h3>About the product</h3>
            <p>From the middle of 1990s, digital video surveillance system was used in safeguarding
               applications to upgrade previous CCTV (Closed-circuit Television) system.
               GoldenEye digital video surveillance system was one of the first products that 
               dominated Chinese market. GoldenEye is a PC-based system that makes it very easy 
               to evolve with the needs of market and the progress of technology.</p>
            <p>Early versions of GoldenEye system worked in a local mode. The system core is 
               DVR (Digital Video Recorder). Multiple videos are connected into local 
               surveillance center via cables, captured and compressed with DVR, then recorded 
               into disk files. Usually, the surveillance center  
               equipped with a video monitors array (or display wall). The system provides 
               interface to control the displaying and recording of the videos. In addition, the system 
               may integrate functions like alarms I/O, video motion or audio silence detection, timing 
               actions, or actions driven by events.</p>
            <p>The broad-band networks were widely deployed from the last of 1990s, which together 
               with the advancing of digital video compression techniques, made it possible to 
               transmit multiple videos over networks. Functions like remote video surveillance 
               were introduced into digital video surveillance system. The video compressed with 
               MPEG-1 or H.261/263 standards can be transmitted from local surveillance center to 
               remote users in the form of stream media. The users may watch one to four videos 
               remotely over Intranet, even Internet. </p>
            <p>The rapid growth of Internet band-width and high-efficient video compress standards 
               like MPEG-4 and H.264 make it possible to transmit high-quality videos over Internet. 
               To support larger scale video surveillance, the surveillance center of the new system 
               is not set on local any more. Videos in a large geographical range are 
               captured and compressed locally, then transmitted to the surveillance center over 
               network (or Internet). The videos are recorded into disk files or decompressed and 
               displayed on monitors. This kind of video surveillance system is named 
               NVR (Network Video Recorder).
